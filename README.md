üöÄ How to Use
1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Export Your WhatsApp Chat
To use this analyzer, you first need to export your WhatsApp chat.

Open the WhatsApp chat you want to analyze.

Tap on the three dots (menu) in the top right corner.

Go to More > Export chat.

Choose Without Media. (The analyzer currently focuses on text and counts media/links as separate entities, but doesn't process the media itself).

Save the .txt file to your device.

3. Setup the Project
Clone this repository (if applicable) or download the files:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/whatsapp-chat-analyzer.git
cd whatsapp-chat-analyzer

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username or the repository URL)

Install Dependencies:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux

Then install the required libraries:

pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib wordcloud emoji nltk

Ensure Helper Files are Present:
Make sure preprocessor.py and helper.py are in the same directory as app.py (your main Streamlit script). These files contain the core logic for data cleaning and analysis.

Navigate to the project directory where app.py is located.

Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the WhatsApp Chat Analyzer application.
